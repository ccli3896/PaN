# PaN
Prediction and noise can implement flexible reward-seeking behavior.

## Demo notebook
The demo notebook includes walkthroughs of the base PaN algorithm and generates plots in Appendix Figure 12. These are experiments with a PaN network with 30 hidden neurons and three possible actions with reward values (0,0,.5). 

## Scripts
Scripts are labelled with their corresponding figure and a description.
